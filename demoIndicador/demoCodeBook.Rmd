### Getting and Cleaning Data Project 
#### Experimental design and background

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

#### Raw data
We will be using a set of six raw data files, 3 sets for test data and 3 sets for training data.
Each correspondent file from both sets have identical layout.
Both sets of 3 files each are composed of 3 files That together identify the activity and the subject associated to the observations.

The description of these raw files follows bellow:

* activity_labels.txt
    
    + description: Links the class labels with their activity name. **Used only as a reference**. 
    
    + contents: activity label ID, activity name

* features.txt
    + description: List of all features measured and present into the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files. **Used only as a reference**.
    + contents: 
    
> test and train data sets

Both test and train datasets share the same file layout. The common description follows bellow:

* X_test.txt and X_train.txt

* subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
    + description: each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
    + contents: subject ID
* y_test.txt and y_train.txt
    + description: test and train activity labels.
    + contents: activity label ID

#### Processed data

We will perform the following transformations, detailed explained in the README.md file:

1. merging the datasets X_test (measurements), subject_test (subjects) and y_test (activity labels) into one single file for test dataset
2. merging the datasets X_train (measurements), subject_train (subjects) and y_train (activity labels) into one single file for train dataset
3. merging both datasets above into one single dataset for all the subjects (train and test)
4. changing the activity ID labels to activity names
5. selecting only the mean and standard deviations variables to work with
6. changing the variable names to more meningful names
7. sumarizing the variable mean grouped by activity and subject
8. writing the data into the tidy text file requested


The description of the tidy dataset follows bellow:
